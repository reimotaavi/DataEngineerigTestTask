# DataEngineerigTestTask

For the setup, download the folder and upload it to Jupyter Notebook.

In the folder, there are 2 .ipynb files end .exe file. The .exe file is web driver used to connect to a website.

First run the get_data.ipynb file.

After it has completed, run the api.ipynb file.

Use a program to send a GET request to the IP address. I used Postman.
